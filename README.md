## 'Statistical Arbitrage in the U.S Equities Market' by Avallaneda and Lee (2008)

The paper recreated in this project is located ![here](https://github.com/haezera/stat-arb-in-us-equities/blob/main/stat-arb-in-the-us-equities-market.pdf) [I have stored a copy in this repository].

### Some notes about this project

This project is largely focused on research around the implementation of statistical arbitrage techniques in American equities throughout history, it's resilience to drawdowns, and improvements that can be made to the strategy.

For the benefit of the reader and anyone who stumbles onto this repository wanting to learn more about statistical arbitrage, I have included all of the data filling scripts **as well as the dumps** for my SQL tables, and the SQL schemas themselves. This means that recreating this repository is really easy. 

I have also used `.env` files where possible so that the running of the notebooks and scripts is as simple as possible.
